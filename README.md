# Blink Package Manager
Blink is a source-based package manager designed for performance and control. It serves as the core component of ApertureOS. Every package compiles directly from source code, enabling deep customization and optimization of your software environment.  

As fully open-source software (FOSS), Blink grants unrestricted freedom: use it in any project, modify its codebase, distribute custom builds, or contribute to upstream development.
