# i hope whoever is reading this can feel how much fucking time i 
# spent (over 1.5hours) to fix a bug about reading files and directories and whatnot
# because i forgot i used relative paths and not absolute so i was running the binary from 
# / and not /src (/ = the root directory of the project) so it was fucking me up, also
# i hope whenever i had the idea to use absolute path, in another reality/universe
# someone would shoot my in the leg 2 times so i had to go to the hospital and never
# made that decision. well thats all folks, remember to not use relative paths, even for testing!
